\usage{
geom_timeline_label(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", ..., parse = FALSE, nudge_x = 0, nudge_y = 0,
  check_overlap = FALSE, na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE, nmax = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Geometrical mapping to use (see ggplot2)}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
   options:

   If `NULL`, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
   data as specified in the call to [ggplot()].

   A `data.frame`, or other object, will override the plot
   data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
   [fortify()] for which variables will be created.

   A `function` will be called with a single argument,
   the plot data. The return value must be a `data.frame.`, and
   will be used as the layer data.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to [layer()]. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
`color = "red"` or `size = 3`. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{parse}{Wether or not to parse the label text (see ggplot2 geom text)}

\item{nudge_x}{Amount by which to shift the label on the x axis relative to the point}

\item{nudge_y}{Amount by which to shift the label on the y axis relative to the point}

\item{check_overlap}{Wether or not to check for overlapping label texts (see ggplot2 geom text)}

\item{na.rm}{If `FALSE`, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If `TRUE`, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
`NA`, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
`FALSE` never includes, and `TRUE` always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If `FALSE`, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. [borders()].}

\item{nmax}{Number of earthquakes to be labeled. (Will be top earthquakes according to magnitude aesthetic)}
}
\description{
Add Labels to Timeline Visualisation
}
\details{
The timeline_label geom adds a text variable as lable to the most significant earthquakes.
}
\section{Aesthetics}{

\code{geom_timeline_label} understands the following asthetics:
\itemize{
 \item{"x"}{ Variable (normally date) positioning the labels on the timeline}
 \item{"y} {Variable for adding labels to multiple parallel timelines}
 \item{"label"}{Labels to be added to timeline points}
 \item{"magnitude"}{Magnitude variable according to which to determine the top nmax earthquakes}
}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
ggplot(data = df[COUNTRY \%in\% c("CHINA","USA") & YEAR >= 2000],
 aes(x = DATE, y = COUNTRY,
 color = DEATHS, size = EQ_PRIMARY)) + geom_timeline(alpha = 0.2) +
    geom_timeline(alpha = 0.2) + geom_timeline_label(aes(magnitude = INTENSITY,
     label = LOCATION_NAME),nudge_y = 0.2,)}
}
